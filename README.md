# ArduinoEncrypter
Encrypt data between arduino and C++ interface

Use this [git](https://github.com/gpg/gnupg) as reference documentation.

## Tasks

- [ ] [Document] How we will proceed
- [ ] [Document] Search a way to use gpg in a Cpp application control with implementation test
- [ ] [Document] Search a way to use gpg with an arduino control with implementation test
- [ ] [Document] Use wifi with Arduino and then connect arduino with TCP to PC with test implementation
- [ ] [Code] PC connection with TCP to Arduino
- [ ] [Code] Arduino connection with TCP to PC
- [ ] [Code] Arduino create gpg key and save it into EEPROM 
- [ ] [Code] PC create symetric key
- [ ] [Code] Dialog between Arduino and PC to exchange symetric key
- [ ] [Code] Arduino encrypt with sym key (must use smth as "Mode Cipher Block Chaining")
- [ ] [Code] PC decrypt
